I am a PhD student in accelerator physics at the University of Bonn, working at the ELSA facility.

Research and current work
- Development of a 50 kV Pierce-type DC electron gun using thermal emission and thermally assisted photoemission from a dispenser cathode.
- Design of an electron gun test stand; planning a possible later renovation of the injector beamline into an S-band linac.
- Simulation and analysis with ASTRA and CST Studio; routine development and data processing in Python.
- Frequent use of LaTeX for documentation and figures (tikz / pgfplots for custom plots); past use of C++ for image processing and fitting.
